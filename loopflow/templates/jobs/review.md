## Proposed Draft

Review each draft separately and identify 3-5 criteria for forcus. For each criterion, provide a score from 1 to 10, discuss which parts of this proposal are most relevant to the criterion, and specific recommendations for improvement on that criterion.


Finish with an overall summary of where the proposal most succeeds and where further iteration would be most valuable.
