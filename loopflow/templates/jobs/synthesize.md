## Instructions
Synthesize a new draft of this file. Start by reflecting on the feedback of prior drafts. 
Consider if there are any root issues that could be addressed for a higher-order shift in design.
Then, iterate on ways to combine the strongest elements from each draft.
Finally, check to make sure all feasible improvements are implemented.

Provide only the final implementation code without additional explanation or commentary. This version will be submitted to the user.
